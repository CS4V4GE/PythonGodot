This repo is a dump of all of my python files.
If we are working on a team doc and there are no files stating "teamFile" or any comments in the file that you are looking at that state it is a teamFile
Feel free to learn off of the file for your own assignment, but please do not edit the files or directly ctl+c ctl+v / copy and paste any work.
There may be code that is not directly in the python class, they are probably personal code files. Do not edit.

#### variables (and good names) - What kind of comment is this?
# create a string variable
name = "bill"
# create an integer variable
age = 10
# create a float variable
age = 10.5
#### input
# get input from the user and store it in a variable
age = input('Enter your age    ')
# get a number from the user (decide if you want to convert now or later)

number = input(' enter a int    ')
number = int

#### output and f-strings
# output all the variables with a single print statement
print(f"Hey whats up {name.upper()}?")
# now use an f-string to output all the variables


# output all the variables again, but use a string method on one 
# so that it prints in upper case, lower case, or title case
